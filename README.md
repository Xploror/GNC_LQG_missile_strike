# GNC_LQG_missile_strike

This project is about implementing an LQG algorithm on a missile whose state model is partially unstable and implementing Guidance Navigation and Control logic to strike a missile on a given target coordinates. After making the required simulink model the mission is then implemented on FlightGear for visualization.
